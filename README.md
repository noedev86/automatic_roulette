# automatic_roulette
An automatic python code that is applying the martingale Strategy to the classic casino roulette

RUNNING ON VERSION 3 !

Just add the pyautogui library to your python, and run the code and see how it makes money ! 
The images I put (lost and won) are maybe not adapted to your screen, make sure you screenshot again
a section that is appearing when you LOOSE and when you WIN, the program makes his decision based on that.

Also : Use it on 1xbet, I used it on the evolution speed roulette (where you don't have anyone on the video, because I always feel sad when I see people working there)
